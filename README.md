 Website Refresh
I've made some exciting changes to my website.

 What's New?
- CSS Makeover: I've tidied up our CSS styles by breaking them down into separate files. This makes it easier for us to manage and update our site's look and feel.
- Nav Bar Tweaks: I've given our navigation bar a bit of a facelift. It's now more user-friendly and visually appealing.

 Why?
These changes are all about making my website more maintainable, efficient, and enjoyable to use. By organizing my CSS and refining my nav bar, i am setting myself up for future success and providing a better experience for our visitors.

 Let's Keep Improving!
I'm always looking for ways to enhance my website. If you've got ideas or feedback, don't hesitate to share
